# decorator 

In angular we use decorator and attach it to a class and make that class a component

# Componetnt
First use of component and showing them dynamically on the web

# service
we have created a service and will use it in our component class

# dependency Injection
for this we will have to register our dependencies on the app module for example checkout the provider class in app module.ts

# shortcut code for generating file using ANGULAR cli
create project = ng new 
install angular-cli = npm install -g @angular/cli
serve = ng serve
host = ng host
creating new component = ng g c newcomponentp[name]
creating services = ng g s emai[name]

# Injectable
we will need this only when we have dependencies in its constructor
